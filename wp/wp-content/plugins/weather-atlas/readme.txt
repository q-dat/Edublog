= Responsive Web Design =
When placed in a horizontal layout (e.g., within an article), the widget reformats to a vertical layout on mobile devices.
Details of the current condition (such as feels-like temperature, wind, humidity, pressure, UV index) and forecasts extending beyond 3 hours/days are hidden on mobile devices to maintain an uncluttered appearance and preserve the design on narrow displays.

= Easy Styling =
Choose from two predefined layouts (vertical and horizontal) and customize the widget to fit your website.
Font size can be manually set (in px, pt, em, rem, %, etc.) to override the automatic adjustment to the website's font size and page placement.
Background color, which adapts to the current temperature, can be set to a fixed color, including transparency options.
Text color, automatically optimized for contrast against the background, can also be manually overridden.

= Weather Icons =
The weather condition icons are elegantly designed, simple, and adapt in size, color, and shade to match the widget’s text.

= Comprehensive Data =
Select from a range of weather information, including current conditions, hourly, and long-term forecasts.
Current conditions display temperature, weather icon, feels-like temperature, wind, humidity, pressure, UV index, and sunrise/sunset times.
Hourly forecasts provide up to 5 hours of temperature predictions with weather icons, while the daily forecast offers up to 5 days of high/low temperatures and weather conditions.

= Versatile Placement =
The Weather Atlas Widget is designed for flexibility, allowing placement either in a sidebar or within the main content of your site.
It supports integration through user-friendly Gutenberg blocks or via a simple shortcode option, offering versatility and ease of use within your WordPress site.

= Worldwide Locations =
Access over 800,000 locations from 238 countries and territories. Your location is likely included :)

= Languages =
The widget automatically selects the language based on your site's language settings (Settings / General / Site Language).
If a local translation is unavailable, it defaults to English.
Local translations can be updated for further customization.

= Units =
Weather data is displayed in either the Imperial (°F, in, mi) or Metric system (°C, mb, mm, km).

= Multiple Widgets Option =
Multiple widgets can be placed on the same page, each with individual settings and operating independently.
The widgets display cached weather data from your database and periodically update from our service, ensuring no slowdown to your website.

= Easy Setup =
All options are straightforward to configure. For further assistance, please visit our [FAQ](../plugins/weather-atlas/#faq) and then drop us a line in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weather-atlas).
